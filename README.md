# Robo Advisor & Share Trading Game
This project includes a robo advisor integrated into a web app that enables users to simulate a share trading game. Both the robo advisor and the trading game were used in a management research experiment with 500+ students at the Institute of Electronic Commerce and Digital Markets of the Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich.

# Tech Stack
This robo advisor was built with 3 Microsoft Azure services. 
1. The Azure Bot Service provides both the frontend (VanillaJS) and the backend (NodeJS - restify) for the robo advisor.   
2. The Language Understanding Service (LUIS) adds natural language understanding - based on intents and entities - to the robo advisor.
3. The QnA Maker Service allows the robo advisor to respond to questions with pre-defined answers.
